Model Vs. Meshes:
-Mesh  : A collection of 3D points, when combined together [defined some physical presence/ physicality of some object].
-Model : "Things that contain the Mesh and all the other stuff"

Mesh:
- Every Mesh is made up of a [series of triangles]
- Triangles are used because triangle is the most complex polygon that is simple enough to build complex things.
- Why Triangle?
	-Every series of three points will define some shape.
	-You can always connect three dots without the lines crossing each other.
	-3 points will always produce a flat shape.

-Texture itself can't go on meshes
  Only Materials can go on meshes
  -> However, Unity will let us cheat and let you drag texture into a mesh. Unity will create a new material for you.
  -> This is no the formal way to do it!
  -> You should make the material yourself.

Materials
- Materials are made of 
	-> Texture - Note: Aniso level - what the quality of the texture is when we look at extream angle.
	-> Shader  - Responsible for telling material which property it can take (e.g. shininess, main color, decal)
		   - For example: diffuse -> evenly lit, nicely flat shader
		   - Note: Offset - shifting the tiling left/right
			   Tiling - how many times the texture repeats


Mesh Renderer & Mesh Filter:
- Tells us how the game object is drawn

Default-Diffuse (Material)
- "Skin for the Mesh that gives a more robust model experience"

Performance Tip:
- Looking at Stats gives us triangles and vertices counts on a particular scene
- The more vertices or polygons you have per scene, the more computing intensive it is.
- Quad vs. Plane
