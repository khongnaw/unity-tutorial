Parenting/Nesting/Grouping:
- "Helps us keep items together and make items behave in specific way"
- Nested object coordinate will be relative to its parent position. (e.g. (0,0) is at the center of parent object)


Coordinate System:
-"Everything in video game is based off a Coordinate systems (Cartesian system)".
-"It is how we develop and build games to be rendered on the screen. (e.g. Mario is based on 2D coordinate system)"
- NOT ALL GAME Engine used to same coordinate system. 
	* (for Unity y-up/down, x-left/right, z-in/out)
	* Importing assets into other engine can be problametic.

Global (World) vs. Local Coordinate System
- Global - shared accross all game objects, all relative to the World's coordinate.
- Local - Coordinate relative to the game object. (e.g. (0,0) is at the center of a square object)

Game Object:
- "The most fundamental element of the scene"
- "Every scene is made of many game objects (e.g. tree, sun, player)"
- "At its core, game objects are EMPTY containers that can be stacked a bunch of things/functionalities into."

Plane Object:
- "Very useful...for putting stuff on it...Makes great back stop"

Component:
- "Things we add to game object to give them abilities"

Transform Vs. Transformation:
 * Transform
	- It's a unique position, rotation, and scale of game object.
	- "Every game object has a transform"
 * Transformation
	- [Change in] position, rotation, or scale.
	- "Perform a transformation on a transform"

Three Types of Transformation:
1. Translation- moving left/right/up/down
2. Rotation   - rotate object about its axis ("rotate about an axis, imagine a pin going through the axis")
3. Scale      - scale (e.g, if I want object to be two times bigger, multiple the current scale by 2)

Tips: lighiting
- When you add a light component to a scene, Unity automatically turns of universal lighting.
  This causes objects to appear dark.
- Click on a light icon to turn universal light on.

Note:
- Red   -> X-axis
- Blue  -> Z-axis
- Green -> Y-axis
